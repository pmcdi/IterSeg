# Results Directory

This directory stores the latest model weights for every dataset. This would be a symbolic link to the nnunet_results directory after model training.

Example Directory Structure:

```bash 
└── results
    └── PM_IASLC
        └── latest -> ../PM_IASLC/2025-06-05__PM_IASLC/nnUNet_results/
```
